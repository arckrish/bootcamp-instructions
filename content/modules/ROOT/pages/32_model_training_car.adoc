# Model Training with Custom Notebook

## In this module you will sync a git repo and run through a the parasol-insurnace Jupyter notebooks. 

We will use the custom image we created and uploaded before and we will create a workbench with the customer image we uploaded in module 04.  

## Steps to create workbench with a custom notebook
