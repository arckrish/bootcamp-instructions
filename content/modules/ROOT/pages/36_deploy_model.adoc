In this section we will serve our model in our RHOAI instance using Gitops. We will also use a Custom serving runtime (Triton) in order to deploy the model.

To do this we would need a data connection to the S3 instance where our model is stored, and we would need to create the Custom serving runtime and an Inference server 

## Custom Serving runtime

RHOAI supports the ability to add your own serving runtime. But it does not support the runtimes themselves. Therefore, it is up to you to configure, adjust and maintain your custom runtimes.

In this tutorial we will setup the Triton Runtime (NVIDIA Triton Inference Server). Use the following steps to add the runtime:

. In the `parasol-insurance` tenant, create a directory named `multi-model-serving`

. Create the `base` and `overlays` directories inside the `multi-model-serving` directory

. Create a directory named `parasol-insurance-dev` under the `multi-model-serving/overlays` directory

. Create a file named `kustomization.yaml` inside the `multi-model-serving/overlays/parasol-insurance-dev` directory with the following content:

+
.multi-model-serving/overlays/parasol-insurance-dev/kustomization.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

resources:
  - ../../base
----

. Create a file named `kustomization.yaml` inside the `multi-model-serving/base` directory with the following content:

+
.multi-model-serving/base/kustomization.yaml
[source,yaml]
----

kind: Kustomization

namespace: parasol-insurance

resources:
  - data-connection.yaml
  - inference-service.yaml
  - serving-runtime.yaml
----

. To create a data connection, create a file named 'data-connection.yaml' inside the `multi-model-serving/base` directory with the following content:

+
.multi-model-serving/base/data-connection.yaml
[source,yaml]

. Push the changes to the ai-accelerator repository

. Wait for the application to sync

. Navigate to RHOAI, and validate that there is a new model serving under the `Models` tab, and check that its status looks green.

## Test the served model

To test if the served model is working as expected, go back to RHOAI `parasol-insurance` project and go to the _workbenches_ tab. Stop the `standard-workbench` and start the `custom-workbench`. Once the custom-workbench is running, navigate to `parasol-insurance/lab-materials/04`. Open the `04-05-model-serving` notebook. We need to change the RestURL/infer_url value. We can get it from the model that we just deployed.

Make sure to change the values in the notebook when testing:

image::images/model_serving_notebook_changes.png[]

After making these changes, run the notebook and we should see an output to the image that we pass to the model.

[TIP]
==== 
Validate changes against https://github.com/redhat-ai-services/ai-accelerator-qa/pull/new/36_deploy_model[Deploy model branch]
====

[CAUTION]
====
You have now entered the CHALLENGE PHASE of your project! You are now enabled! Your team lead has died! You must Deploy the model to prod ideally using gitops. 

 - Level 1 Use minio ui to create your buckets and deploy your model serving rumtime!
 - Level 2 Use gitops to deploy your model to prod and deploy your model serving runtime!
 - Level 3 Train your own model and deploy it to prod and automate the uploading and model serving!
