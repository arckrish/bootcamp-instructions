## ArgoCD 

There is currently an issue where after a cluster shutdown your argoCD url stops working. There is a script in source_code/00_useful_tips/ for your convenience, the commands to recovery are also below.  

```bash
oc delete argocd --all -n openshift-gitops
oc delete pods --all -n openshift-gitops-operator
```

Rerun the _**bootstrap.sh**_ script and choose the correct overlay.
